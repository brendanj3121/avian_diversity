# Avian Biodiversity in Colorado Springs' Urban Greenspaces
These files contain the Google Earth Engine code that was used to develop the imagery and analysis in this ArcGIS StoryMap: https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/a9d2e85f26b94804aabd53fc4c82ac91

The file, *ndvi.js*, contains the code that was used to develop the seasonal NDVI maps and corresponding statistical analysis, and *tgdi_classification.js* contains the code for the TGDI analysis.

Both of these files require imported geometries for the analysis, which can be copied from the corresponding files titled *ndvi_imports.js* and *tgdi_imports.js*, then converted to import records within Google Earth Engine.

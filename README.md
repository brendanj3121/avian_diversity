These files contain the Google Earth Engine code that was used to develop the imagery and analysis in this ArcGIS StoryMap: 

The file, *ndvi*, contains the code that was used to develop the seasonal NDVI maps and corresponding statistical analysis, and *tgdi_classification* contains the code for the TGDI analysis.

Both of these files require imported geometries for the analysis, which can be copied from the corresponding files titled *ndvi_imports* and *tgdi_imports* then converted to import records within Google Earth Engine.
